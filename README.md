# MedGAN: Medical Image Generation with GANs

MedGAN is a collection of implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed for generating medical images, with a focus on brain tumor MRI scans. This repository includes state-of-the-art GAN architectures optimized for high-quality, diverse, and stable image generation.

---

## Implemented GAN Architectures

The repository includes the following GAN architectures:

- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)  
  Utilizes convolutional layers to generate high-quality images efficiently.

- **ProGAN (Progressive Growing of GANs):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)  
  Features progressive training for enhanced stability and image quality.

- **StyleGAN & StyleGAN2:**  
  - **StyleGAN:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948)  
    A style-based generator offering fine-grained control over image features.  
  - **StyleGAN2:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958)  
    Enhances StyleGAN with fewer artifacts and improved image clarity.

- **WGAN (Wasserstein GAN):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)  
  Improves training stability through the Wasserstein distance metric.

- **CycleGAN:**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)  
  Focuses on image-to-image translation with cycle consistency for domain adaptation.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Brain Tumor MRI Scans dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?select=glioma) available on Kaggle.  
Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset` directory before starting model training.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozaloom/medgan
cd medgan
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset
Download the [Brain Tumor MRI Scans dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?select=glioma) and save it in the `dataset` directory.

### 4. Train a Model
Each GAN architecture has its own training script located in its respective folder (e.g., `ProGAN/`, `StyleGAN2/`).  
Refer to the specific folder for details on training parameters and scripts.

## Examples of Generated Images

Hereâ€™s an example of an image generated using **ProGAN** after 180 epochs (Step 5):

### Adjustments Made:
1. Consolidated the sections to make them flow better.
2. Removed redundant section breaks to create a seamless read.
3. Unified tone and structure for better readability.  
This version should be easier to read and navigate!
