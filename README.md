# MedGAN: Medical Image Generation with GANs

This repository contains implementations of various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed for generating medical images, specifically brain tumor MRI scans.

---

## Implemented GAN Architectures

This project includes the following GAN architectures:

- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GANs):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)  
  Utilizes convolutional layers to generate high-quality images.

- **ProGAN (Progressive Growing of GANs):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)  
  Features progressive training for improved image quality, stability, and diversity.

- **StyleGAN & StyleGAN2:**  
  - **StyleGAN:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948)  
    Introduces a style-based generator for better control over image generation.  
  - **StyleGAN2:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958)  
    Enhances StyleGAN by reducing artifacts and improving output quality.

- **WGAN (Wasserstein GAN):**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)  
  Provides more stable training by employing the Wasserstein distance.

- **CycleGAN:**  
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)  
  Enables image-to-image translation through cycle consistency.

## Dataset

This project uses an open-source dataset of brain tumor MRI scans:  
[Brain Tumor MRI Scans on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?select=glioma).

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start training the models:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mozaloom/medgan
   cd medgan
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Install the required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**  
   Download the dataset from the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?select=glioma) and place it in the `dataset` directory.

4. **Train a Model:**  
   Each GAN has its own training script. Navigate to the corresponding folder for instructions specific to that model.

## Examples of Generated Images

Here are some examples of images generated by the models:

- **ProGAN (180 epochs, step 5):**
